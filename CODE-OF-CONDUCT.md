# Code of Conduct

Version 2024.07.09

The [Scottish Programming Languages and Verification Summer School](https://spli.scot/splv/) (SPLV) is a collaborative effort between the Universities of
Edinburgh,
Glasgow,
Heriot-Watt,
Strathclyde
and
St Andrews.
SPLV is organised as part of the wider remit of the [Scottish Programming Languages Institute](https://spli.scot/) (SPLI).
More information about SPLI and SPLV is available online.

We will use SPLV to refer to the physical and virtual communities
(participants,
members,
contributors,
and
leaders)
involved during the running of any SPLV related event.


*The Organisers* refers to the principal organisers for SPLV, and other volunteers involved with the running of SPLV.
The list of principal SPLV organisers for each edition is available on their respective website.
For SPLV 2024 the list is [provided here](https://spli.scot/splv/2024-strathclyde/#further-information).

## Our Goal

The SPLV community pledges to provide a harassment-free experience for everyone involved with SPLV.
Regardless of age,
body size,
visible or invisible disability,
ethnicity,
sex characteristics,
gender identity and expression,
level of experience,
education,
socio-economic status,
nationality,
personal appearance,
race,
caste,
colour,
religion,
or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy communities.

## Applicability & Scope

This code of conduct applies to all SPLV community spaces,
both online and offline.
Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from these spaces at the discretion of the organisers.

Our code of conduct also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official email address,
posting via an official social media account,
or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

The SPLS Zulip Chat Service which houses the virtual SPLV community has its own [Code of Conduct](https://spli.scot/spls/CONDUCT.html).

## Towards a Welcoming and Safe Environment

SPLV hopes to create an environment in which diverse individuals can collaborate and interact in a positive and affirming way.
Examples of behaviour that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people;
* Being respectful of differing opinions,
  viewpoints,
  and experiences;
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback;
* Accepting responsibility and apologising to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience;
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals,
  but for the overall community;

## Anti-Harassment Statement

SPLV will not tolerate harassment of any kind.
Examples of unacceptable behaviour include:

* The use of sexualised language or imagery,
  and sexual attention or advances of any kind;
* Trolling,
  insulting or derogatory comments,
  and personal or political attacks;
* Public or private harassment;
* Publishing others' private information,
  such as a physical or email address,
  without their explicit permission;
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting;

If group members have questions or concerns about these issues,
reach out to any of the organisers.

## Reporting

If any member of the SPLV community is being harassed by another member of our community,
notice that someone else is being harassed,
or have any other concerns,
please get in contact directly with an organiser during the event.

All SPLV organisers will be clearly identifiable during the running of SPLV.

Alternatively you can email:

    CIS_splv2024@groups.strath.ac.uk

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

If an organiser is the harasser,
they will not be involved in handling,
or resolving,
of the incident.
The organising team will respond to any complaint as promptly as possible.

In order to protect volunteers from abuse and burnout,
organisers reserve the right to reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith.
Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without response.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behaviour and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behaviour that they deem inappropriate,
threatening,
offensive,
or
harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove,
edit,
or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Enforcement Process

Every code of conduct violation report will be treated with seriousness and care.
If a memberâ€™s immediate safety and security is threatened,
an individual organiser may take any action that they deem appropriate,
up to and including temporarily banning the offender from any SPLV space.
In less urgent situations,
at least two organisers will discuss the offence and mutually arrive at a suitable response,
which will be shared with the offender privately.
Whatever the resolution they decide upon,
the decision of the admins involved in a violation case will be considered final.

We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse.
At our discretion,
we may publicly name a person about whom we've received harassment complaints,
or privately warn third parties about them,
if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of our members or the general public.
We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.
