# SPLV25: Scottish Programming Languages and Verification Summer School 2025

## University of Edinburgh - 21st to 25th July

This year, the [Scottish Programming Languages and Verification Summer
School](https://spli.scot/splv/) will be held at The University of
Edinburgh.

<!-- Fifteen years ago, when I was a new PhD student and suffering from an
    advanced case of PL myopia, I foolishly ignored every other area of computer
    science. It was only years later that I realized that distributed systems
    had a lot to teach me. In these lectures, I'll fill you in on what I've
    learned so far, so you won't be as foolish as I was. We'll start with the
    very basics (what is a distributed system?) and work our way up to an
    implementation of causal broadcast, then finish the week with a brief
    excursion into choreographic programming. No background in distributed
    systems is necessary, only an open mind. -->

	<!-- Historically there has - surprisingly, perhaps - been something of a
    gulf between the programming languages and software engineering communities,
    which I will argue has been to the detriment of both. One of the many places
    this shows up is in the fields' treatments of bidirectional transformations,
    by which I mean, automated means of checking and restoring appropriate
    notions of consistency between data sources. I will introduce this topic
    from a software engineering perspective, which will necessitate introducing
    modelling and model-driven engineering more generally. I will briefly wave
    at the treatment of the topic in the functional programming community, via
    optics. I will opine about some open problems and some things I think the
    next generation of researchers should pay attention to, in order to narrow
    rather than widen the gulf between PL and SE, to the benefit of both. -->

## Prerequisites

The school is aimed at PhD students in programming languages, verification and
related areas. Researchers and practitioners are very welcome, as are strong
undergraduate and masters students with the support of a supervisor.
Participants will need to have a background in computer science, mathematics or
a related discipline, and have basic familiarity with (functional) programming
and logic.
