This year, the [Scottish Programming Languages and Verification Summer
School](https://spli.scot/splv/) will be held at The University of
Edinburgh.

## Courses

**Program verification using concurrent separation logic** (guest course)

  University Nijmegen

	Concurrent programs are challenging to get right, especially if threads
    share access to memory. The formalism of "concurrent separation Logic"
    (which was pioneered by O'Hearn and Brookes in 2007) provides a powerful
    framework to verify concurrent programs. Over the last 20 years, concurrent
    separation Logic has emerged into an active research field, has been
    extended with many features (e.g., fine-grained concurrency, weak memory
    consistency, higher-order programs), been applied to many programming
    languages (e.g., Rust), and has been implemented in numerous verification
    tools (e.g., F*, Iris, Verifast, Viper, VST). We will discuss the
    foundations of separation logic and show how they scale to the verification
    of challenging concurrent programs. Exercises and demos using the Iris
	framework in the Rocq proof assistant will be provided.

**A few ideas from distributed systems for PL folk** (guest course)

	<summary>Abstract</summary>
	Fifteen years ago, when I was a new PhD student and suffering from an
    advanced case of PL myopia, I foolishly ignored every other area of computer
    science. It was only years later that I realized that distributed systems
    had a lot to teach me. In these lectures, I'll fill you in on what I've
    learned so far, so you won't be as foolish as I was. We'll start with the
    very basics (what is a distributed system?) and work our way up to an
    implementation of causal broadcast, then finish the week with a brief
    excursion into choreographic programming. No background in distributed
    systems is necessary, only an open mind.

**Behavioural types**

: **Lecturer:** [Simon Fowler](https://simonjf.com/about/), University of
  Glasgow

: <details closed>
	<summary>Abstract</summary>
	Much like data types allow us to rule out common programming errors before
    we compile or run a program, behavioural type systems provide a lightweight
    way of checking the correctness of behavioural properties of programs. Three
    examples include typestate, which allows us to ensure that we call object
    methods in the correct order (e.g. opening a file handle for reading before
    performing read operations and eventually closing the handle); session
    types, which allow us to check that a communication follows a protocol; and
    mailbox types, which allow us to specify patterns of messages received in
    many-to-one communication. This course will give an overview of behavioural
    typing, going into depth on the theoretical and practical aspects of session
    types and mailbox types.

**Concurrency theory**

: **Lecturer:** [Rob van Glabbeek](http://theory.stanford.edu/~rvg/), University
  of Edinburgh

: <details closed>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
	This course aims to make students familiar with state-of-the-art techniques
	in modelling concurrent systems. This is done by comparing some of the more
	successful semantic models of concurrency found in the literature, including
	transition systems, Petri nets and process algebras. The focus will be on
	the rationale behind the design decisions underlying those models, viewed
	from philosophical, mathematical and computational perspectives. A central
	concept will be that of a semantic equivalence or preorder, relating system
	specifications and implementations.

**Models, programs and bidirectional transformations**

: **Lecturer:** [Perdita Stevens](https://perditastevens.com/), University of
  Edinburgh

: <details closed>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
	Historically there has - surprisingly, perhaps - been something of a gulf
    between the programming languages and software engineering communities,
    which I will argue has been to the detriment of both. One of the many places
    this shows up is in the fields' treatments of bidirectional transformations,
    by which I mean, automated means of checking and restoring appropriate
    notions of consistency between data sources. I will introduce this topic
    from a software engineering perspective, which will necessitate introducing
    modelling and model-driven engineering more generally. I will briefly wave
    at the treatment of the topic in the functional programming community, via
    optics. I will opine about some open problems and some things I think the
    next generation of researchers should pay attention to, in order to narrow
    rather than widen the gulf between PL and SE, to the benefit of both.

## Prerequisites

The school is aimed at PhD students in programming languages, verification and
related areas. Researchers and practitioners are very welcome, as are strong
undergraduate and masters students with the support of a supervisor.
Participants will need to have a background in computer science, mathematics or
a related discipline, and have basic familiarity with (functional) programming
and logic.
