## Courses

**Program verification using concurrent separation logic** (guest course)
<img class="avatar" src="assets/robbert_krebbers.png" />
: **Guest Lecturer:** [Robbert Krebbers](https://robbertkrebbers.nl/), Radboud
  University Nijmegen

: <details open> <summary>Abstract</summary>
	Concurrent programs are challenging to get right, especially if threads
    share access to memory. The formalism of "concurrent separation Logic"
    (which was pioneered by O'Hearn and Brookes in 2007) provides a powerful
    framework to verify concurrent programs. Over the last 20 years, concurrent
    separation Logic has emerged into an active research field, has been
    extended with many features (e.g., fine-grained concurrency, weak memory
    consistency, higher-order programs), been applied to many programming
    languages (e.g., Rust), and has been implemented in numerous verification
    tools (e.g., F*, Iris, Verifast, Viper, VST). We will discuss the
    foundations of separation logic and show how they scale to the verification
    of challenging concurrent programs. Exercises and demos using the Iris
	framework in the Rocq proof assistant will be provided.

**A few ideas from distributed systems for PL folk** (guest course)
<img class="avatar" src="assets/lindsey_kuper.jpg" />
: **Guest Lecturer:** [Lindsey Kuper](https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~lkuper/),
  University of California, Santa Cruz

: <details open>
	<summary>Abstract</summary>
	Fifteen years ago, when I was a new PhD student and suffering from an
    advanced case of PL myopia, I foolishly ignored every other area of computer
    science. It was only years later that I realized that distributed systems
    had a lot to teach me. In these lectures, I'll fill you in on what I've
    learned so far, so you won't be as foolish as I was. We'll start with the
    very basics (what is a distributed system?) and work our way up to an
    implementation of causal broadcast, then finish the week with a brief
    excursion into choreographic programming. No background in distributed
    systems is necessary, only an open mind.

**Core Course: Type theory**
<img class="avatar" src="assets/fred_forsberg.jpg" />
: **Lecturer:** [Fredrik Nordvall Forsberg](https://fredriknf.com/), University
  of Strathclyde

: <details open>
	<summary>Abstract</summary>
	Type theory is both a foundation of mathematics and an expressive functional
    programming language, and the basis of proof assistants and programming
    languages such as Agda, Idris, Rocq, and Lean. There are many aspects to
    type theory, and these lectures will give an introduction to three of them:
    (i) what it is, and how to work in it (the user's perspective); (ii)
    studying type theory as a formal system, and proving properties such as
    normalisation, canonicity, and subject reduction (the metatheorist's
    perspective); and (iii) models of type theory, and how they suggest new
    axioms, as well as let us conveniently manipulate mathematical structures of
    interest (the semanticist's perspective).

**Core Course: Concurrency theory**
<img class="avatar" src="assets/rob_van_glabbeek.jpg" />
: **Lecturer:** [Rob van Glabbeek](http://theory.stanford.edu/~rvg/), University
  of Edinburgh

: <details open>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
	This course aims to make students familiar with state-of-the-art techniques
	in modelling concurrent systems. This is done by comparing some of the more
	successful semantic models of concurrency found in the literature, including
	transition systems, Petri nets and process algebras. The focus will be on
	the rationale behind the design decisions underlying those models, viewed
	from philosophical, mathematical and computational perspectives. A central
	concept will be that of a semantic equivalence or preorder, relating system
	specifications and implementations.

**Application programming with dependent types**

: **Lecturer:** [Edwin Brady](https://www.type-driven.org.uk/edwinb/),
  University of St Andrews

**Logical relations for program equivalence**
<img class="avatar" src="assets/filip_sieczkowski.png" />
: **Lecturer:** [Filip Sieczkowski](https://fsieczkowski.github.io/),
  Heriot-Watt University

: <details open>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
	In this course we will explore logical relations, as a classic type-based
    method of proving equivalence of programs and, crucially, program
    fragments. We will introduce the problem of program (fragment) equivalence
    and solve it in the setting of simply-typed lambda calculus, and proceed to
    extend the method to some of the features found in modern programming
    languages, including polymorphism, recursion in types and terms, and
    computational effects, ending with a look at extending the methodology to
    type-and-effect systems.

**Models, programs and bidirectional transformations**
<img class="avatar" src="assets/perdita_stevens.jpg" />
: **Lecturer:** [Perdita Stevens](https://perditastevens.com/), University of
  Edinburgh

: <details open>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
	Historically there has - surprisingly, perhaps - been something of a gulf
    between the programming languages and software engineering communities,
    which I will argue has been to the detriment of both. One of the many places
    this shows up is in the fields' treatments of bidirectional transformations,
    by which I mean, automated means of checking and restoring appropriate
    notions of consistency between data sources. I will introduce this topic
    from a software engineering perspective, which will necessitate introducing
    modelling and model-driven engineering more generally. I will briefly wave
    at the treatment of the topic in the functional programming community, via
    optics. I will opine about some open problems and some things I think the
    next generation of researchers should pay attention to, in order to narrow
    rather than widen the gulf between PL and SE, to the benefit of both.

**Behavioural types**
<img class="avatar" src="assets/simon_fowler.png" />
: **Lecturer:** [Simon Fowler](https://simonjf.com/about/), University of
  Glasgow
: <details open>
	<summary>Abstract</summary>
	Much like data types allow us to rule out common programming errors before
    we compile or run a program, behavioural type systems provide a lightweight
    way of checking the correctness of behavioural properties of programs. Three
    examples include typestate, which allows us to ensure that we call object
    methods in the correct order (e.g. opening a file handle for reading before
    performing read operations and eventually closing the handle); session
    types, which allow us to check that a communication follows a protocol; and
    mailbox types, which allow us to specify patterns of messages received in
    many-to-one communication. This course will give an overview of behavioural
    typing, going into depth on the theoretical and practical aspects of session
    types and mailbox types.
