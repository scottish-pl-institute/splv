Scotland is internationally renowned for its leading expertise in
programming language design,
implementation,
and
formal program verification.
Since 2019,
the [*Scottish Programming Languages and Verification Summer School*](https://scottish-pl-institute.github.io/splv/) (SPLV) has provided local and international students with foundational and advanced learning on topics in programming languages and verification research.
SPLV's core mission is to:

1. Provide essential research training for postgraduate students
2. Broaden participants' knowledge by exposing them to cutting edge research
3. Facilitate networking between students and established researchers
4. Foster the Scottish Programming Languages community

Each edition of SPLV has been well attended by local PhD students, as well as attracting international PhD students, academics, and industrial practitioners.

SPLV 2024 is organised by the University of Strathclyde, with support from the [Scottish Programming Languages Institute](https://scottish-pl-institute.github.io) (SPLI) and [Scottish Informatics and Computer Science Alliance](https://www.sicsa.ac.uk/) (SICSA).
The core theme of SPLV 2024 is *putting theory into practice*, enabling students to learn how cutting edge theoretical research can be applied to address practical software engineering problems.
Our courses cover a range of topics including type theory, category theory, protocol verification, and effect handlers.

The SPLV 2024 Invited Lecturer is [Dr. Lindsey Kuper](https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~lkuper/),
Assistant Professor at the University of California Santa Cruz.
Dr. Kuper's research draws on the research traditions of programming languages, distributed systems, and software verification.
Specifically, Dr. Kuper uses programming-language-based approaches to build concurrent and distributed software systems that are elegant, correct, and efficient.
