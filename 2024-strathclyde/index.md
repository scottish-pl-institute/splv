# SPLV24: Scottish Programming Languages and Verification Summer School, 2024

## Glasgow, UK --- July 29<sup>th</sup> to August 2<sup>nd</sup>


This year, the [Scottish Programming Languages and Verification Summer School](..)
will be held in Strathclyde.
The event is organized by the [Computer and Information Sciences](https://www.strath.ac.uk/science/computerinformationsciences/)
department at the [University of Strathclyde](https://www.strath.ac.uk/).

**A few ideas from distributed systems for PL folk**
: **Invited Lecturer:** [Lindsey Kuper](https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~lkuper/)
: <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    Fifteen years ago, when I was a new PhD student and suffering from an
    advanced case of PL myopia, I foolishly ignored every other area of
    computer science. It was only years later that I realized that distributed
    systems had a lot to teach me.  In these lectures, I'll fill you in on what
    I've learned so far, so you won't be as foolish as I was. We'll start with
    the very basics (what is a distributed system?) and work our way up to an
    implementation of causal broadcast, then finish the week with a brief
    excursion into choreographic programming.  No background in distributed
    systems is necessary, only an open mind.

    <summary>Bio</summary>
    Lindsey Kuper is an Assistant Professor at the University of California,
    Santa Cruz.  She works on programming-language-based approaches to building
    concurrent and distributed software systems that are elegant, correct, and
    efficient. Some of her research contributions include library-level
    choreographic programming, verification of distributed protocols using
    refinement types, and guaranteed-deterministic parallel programming with
    LVars. She co-founded !!Con
    (<a href="https://bangbangcon.com">bangbangcon.com</a>), the radically
    inclusive conference of ten-minute talks on the joy, excitement, and
    surprise of computing.  She is the recipient of an ICFP Distinguished
    Paper Award (2023), an NSF CAREER Award (2022), and a Google Faculty
    Research Award (2019), and received her Ph.D. in computer science in 2015
    from Indiana University.

## Specialised Courses

The specialised courses are offered as two tracks running in parallel.
The interleaving is currently TBC.

### Track 1
{: .flex-element }

**Type Theory & Implicit Complexity**
: **Lecturer:** [Bob Atkey](https://bentnib.org/)
: <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    Implicit Computational Complexity is concerned with the
    characterisation of computational complexity classes as programming
    languages. A programming language characterises a complexity class if
    every function in that class can be implemented in the language and
    every function implementable in the language is in the class.

    In this course I will show how to use Linear Type Theory to
    characterise the class of Polynomial Time computable functions, and
    how by using Linear Dependent Types, we can use this describe other
    classes such as NP, coNP and beyond.
  </details>

**Mechanization of Binders**
: **Lecturer:** [Kathrin Stark](https://www.k-stark.de/)
: <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    Binders are ubiquitous when mechanising results about programming languages.
    More than 15 years after the POPLMark Challenge, new tools and approaches
    to binding are still being published, and binders are still frequently
    mentioned as being the main difference between mechanisation and paper proof.
    So which one to choose: named, de Bruijn, locally nameless, nominal syntax
    or HOAS? While not answering this question, this course takes a (necessarily
    incomplete) peek into several approaches to binders in a programming language,
    with a focus on their mechanisation.

**Category Theory for Semantics**
: **Lecturer:** [Vikraman Choudhury](https://vikraman.org/)
: **Abstract:** *tbc*
</div>

<div class="flex-element" markdown="1">
### Track 2

**Protocol Verification**
: **Lecturer:** [Andrés Goens](https://goens.org/)
: <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    Protocols are central to the functioning of many crucial systems. From
    the consistency of your device's memory, to exchanging information over
    the internet, protocols ensure these extremely concurrent systems
    function correctly. In this course we will consider some basic
    principles required to verify such protocols. We will learn about
    labeled transition systems and use temporal logic to specify properties
    of them. In particular, we will focus on safetey and fairness conditions
    in protocols.
  </details>

**Effects and Handlers**
: **Lecturer:** [Sam Lindley](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/slindley/)
: **Abstract:** *tbc*

**Applied Category Theory**
: **Lecturer:** [Jules Hedges](https://julesh.com/)
: <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    This course will be about symmetric monoidal categories and what they have to tell us about computation and systems. I plan the topics of my 4 lectures to be:
    <ol>
      <li> string diagrams as 2-dimensional syntax, how they unify computation graphs and flowcharts</li>
      <li> traced, compact closed and hypergraph categories, non-well-founded recursion, backtracking and quantum processes</li>
      <li> decorated and structured cospans, the standard sledgehammer for building domain-specific categories of open systems</li>
      <li> bidirectional processes: lenses, optics, containers, differentiable programming, categorical cybernetics</li>
    </ol>

## Details

SPLV 2024 is scheduled to run one full week:

> from 9am on **Monday 29th July** to 2:30pm on **Friday August 2nd**.

Lectures will run face-to-face on-site.
We will use the [SPLS Zulip](https://spls.zulipchat.com/) for online communications (e.g. for questions, arrival/dinner on Sunday, …).

## Prerequisites:

The school is aimed at PhD students in programming languages, verification and related areas.
Researchers and practitioners are very welcome, as are strong undergraduate and masters students with the support of a supervisor.
Participants will need to have a background in computer science, mathematics or a related discipline, and have basic familiarity with (functional) programming and logic.

## Registration:

**TBD**
